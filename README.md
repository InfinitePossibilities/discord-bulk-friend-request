# Discord Bulk Friend Request
This script allows you to send bulk friend requests

# How to use
<b>Ctrl + Shift + I</b> and go to "Console" tab. <br />
Paste in code from code.js and execute/press enter <br />
To stop the script early, simply type <b>clearInterval(interval);</b> into the console. <br />
Change the <b>iteration</b> variable to manipulate where the script starts. <br />
Change the <b>maxIterations</b> variable to manipulate where the script ends. 10000 is the max value. <br />

Hopefully you find your long lost buddy. Note- Discord only allows a maximum of 1000 pending friend-requests at any given time, so use this sparingly. Discord TOS also restricts the automation of User accounts, punishable by account termination due to Botting, use this sparingly.
